# Data-Cleaning
This project is for cleaning more than 40,000 rows of data.

This project is to do the following.
- Read in the CSV using Pandas and print out the DataFrame that is returned
- Get a count of rows within the DataFrame in order to determine if there are any null values

* Drop the rows that contain null values

* Search through the "Offense Type" column and replace any similar values with one consistent value

* Create a couple of DataFrames that look into one Neighborhood only and print them to the screen
